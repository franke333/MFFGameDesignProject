# (Un)fortuned Fate

## Concept
The game is made from a series of scenes where, initially, the main protagonist appears to have met her death. Subsequently, each scene introduces a new element that seemingly caused her death, yet each revelation contradicts the preceding one. The final scene reveals that everyone is unharmed, and nobody is dead.

## Genre
Simple Narative Game

## Player experience
Player is listener to the whole story. The settings is in modern age, in the morning.

## Visual and Audio style
The visuals should evoke a sense of humor and maintain a deliberately unpolished appearance. There will be "TODO" notes and Czech labels, adding a comical touch to the overall visual.

## Game World Fiction
The game will unfold across five scenes:

1. Family:
The first scene introduces the main character within her family environment. Engaging in conversation with family members, she eventually steps outside. A sudden event occurs, creating the illusion that something has fatally impacted her, portrayed through a screen suggesting her death.

2. Taxi Minigame:
The second scene features a minigame with a taxi driver navigating through obstacles. The game will end with a dramatic crash, seemingly involving the main protagonist.

3. Cat:
In the third scene, a couple argues over a cat that has fled from them. The climax will hint that the cat has met a collision with the taxi from the previous scene.

4. Repairman Minigame:
The fourth scene introduces a minigame involving a repairman grappling with a malfunctioning machine. An annoying woman in a window persistently tries to offer guidance, it will result in the machine falling, giving the impression it landed on the main protagonist.

5. Final:
The final scene, presented as an animation through GIMP, reveals that everyone is unharmed, and nobody is dead. This will serve as a humorous twist.
