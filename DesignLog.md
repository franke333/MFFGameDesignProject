I was brainstorming various game ideas and wondering which ones would bepromising. Eventually, I picked on what I
considered the best concept. Frankeyy went through a similar process, and together, we selected one best idea. Following
that, we engaged in several iterations to refine the selected concept.

We divided the work, and my part involved working on scene one. I began by brainstorming the essential details that the
scene should convey, the emotions I aim to evoke in the player, the specific time and place, preceding events,
characters involved, their goals, and the overall structure of the scene.

information to convey:
    - who is mc
    - her family loves her
    - relation between mother and mc
    - they live happy family live
    - mc is going out
    - mc is putting jam in her bag
    - mc is taking bag with jam with her
    - mc is "dead"
    - sound of each incident
emotions to convey:
    - wholesomness at start
    - sadness at end
time and place:
    - at start in the family environment
    - probably in some smaller flat
    - in the kitchen during breakfest
    - it is probably morning
preceding events:
    - mc was getting ready because she wanted to go somewhere
    - before that she was probably sleeping
character:
    - mc:
        - woman
        - age around sixteen?
        - student
        - very positive about everything
        - happy life
    - mother:
        - woman
        - older woman
        - love her daughter
        - taking care of home
    - father:
        - man
        - only reading newspapers
goals:
    - mc wants to each lunch, pack things and go to school
    - mother is probably washing dishes
    - father is reading newspapers and dont care that much

structure:
    (getting up screen?)
    mc comes to kitchen
        introduction to character?
        good morning
        mom asks question
    mc is eating breakfest
    mc is packing stuff
    mc is going out
